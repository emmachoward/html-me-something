                    I am a proud bunny-momma. 
                    My pet rabbit, Cinnabun, loves being petted, and will half close her eyes in bliss when you do so. 
                    She also likes to sit there and do nothing, which as my friend put it, 
                    &quot;I like to sit there and do nothing too!&quot; 
                    She brings me such joy, but you might wonder, 
                    how did I end up with a cinnamon-themed bunny in the first place? 
                    Well, it’s an interesting story&hellip;

                <h2>Finding the Bunny</h2>
                <p>
                    My aunt was in her yard one day when she spotted a rabbit. 
                    Not too uncommon in the Midwest. 
                    Except this was a domesticated rabbit, colorful, chubby, and calm, 
                    letting my aunt pick her up and bring her inside. 
                    Sassy, as she was named, was fed and cared for. 
                    Then one morning, my aunt went to visit Sassy, and found baby bunnies in the cage! 
                    It turns out that Sassy was pregnant when my aunt found her out in the yard. 
                    My aunt found one rabbit, and now had a lot more.
                </p>
                <h2>Pick of the Litter</h2>
                <p>
                    My cousin named the litter of rabbits, and I fell in love with Cinnabun. 
                    She was a molted brown with black feet, ears, and face, like a dark Siamese cat. 
                    Perhaps most fetching of all, she had a little spot of white on the tip of her nose, or as my aunt said, 
                    &quot;The icing on the Cinnabun!&quot; 
                    And she had the softest fur you could imagine.
                </p>
                <h2>Happily Ever After</h2>
                <p>
                    I had a rabbit as a child though, and I was allergic to him, so I was worried about that happening again. 
                    However, I couldn’t stop thinking about Cinnabun. 
                    Eventually I asked my aunt if I could borrow Cinnabun for a week, just to try out it out. 
                    Allergies work in mysterious ways, and as it turned out, I wasn’t allergic to this adorable bunny. 
                    Cinnabun’s been with me ever since!
